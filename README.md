# finalproject

I created this final project to illustrate all the programming languages we were introduced to during the 4-wk VetsInTech Front End Wed Dev Class.
It's a simple botany quiz using HTML, simple CSS styling, and added functionality with JavaSript. 
Answer the questions and press submit to see if you got them all correct.
The quiz doesn't indicate which one(s) you got right if you failed to get all of them correct.
